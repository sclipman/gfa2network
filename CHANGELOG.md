# Changelog

## v0.9.0
- Optimised `genome_distance_matrix` to reuse a cached multi-source Dijkstra per
  path. Runtime now scales linearly with the number of paths and output is
  unchanged.

## v0.8.0
- Added `--store-tags` option to keep tag dictionaries and segment lengths on
  nodes and edges. A `RuntimeWarning` is issued when stored tags exceed
  100&nbsp;MB.
